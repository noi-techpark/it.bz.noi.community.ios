## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running
on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build the project, the following prerequisites must be met:

1. Xcode 12 (downloadable from https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/)
2. Be a member of NOI SPA Apple Developer Team (if you want to run the app and tests on your device)

### Source code

Get a copy of the repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:noi-techpark/it.bz.noi.community.ios.git
```

### Configure the project

No configuration is needed.

## Running tests

The unit tests can be executed on a device by replacing `<device_name>` with your device name with the following command:

```bash
xcodebuild  -project NOICommunity.xcodeproj \
-scheme NOICommunity \
-destination 'platform=iOS,name=<device_name>' \
clean test
```

or on an iOS simulator by replacing `<simulator_name>` with a simulator name with the following command:

```bash
xcodebuild  -project NOICommunity.xcodeproj \
-scheme NOICommunity \
-destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,OS=14.5,name=<simulator_name>' \
clean test
```

When you install Xcode it comes with default simulators, one per each supported device and its simulator name is the device model; e.g. "iPhone 12".
